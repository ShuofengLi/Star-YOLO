Star-YOLO: Lightweight Infrared Ship Detection Framework
This repository provides the core implementation of Star-YOLO, a lightweight and efficient object detection framework specifically designed for infrared ship detection in complex maritime environments. The framework integrates three key components: StarNet backbone, C3k2-LDFB feature enhancement module, and ELDConv attention-guided deformable convolution, implemented within the YOLOv11 detection pipeline.


ðŸ“œ Acknowledgments
This repository builds upon and extends the StarNet backbone implementation. We gratefully acknowledge the authors of the original StarNet work for providing their codebase, which served as a foundation for part of this implementation.
