Star-YOLO: Lightweight Infrared Ship Detection Framework
This repository provides the core implementation of Star-YOLO, a lightweight and efficient object detection framework specifically designed for infrared ship detection in complex maritime environments. The framework integrates three key components: StarNet backbone, C3k2-LDFB feature enhancement module, and ELDConv attention-guided deformable convolution, implemented within the YOLOv11 detection pipeline.
